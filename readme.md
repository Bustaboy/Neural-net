# Neural-net Trading App

Neural-net is a desktop trading application that uses smart computer programs (machine learning) to help you trade stocks or cryptocurrencies automatically. It includes a simple window to manage trades, view your money, and get live market updates, all using a shared database for better predictions.

## What You Can Do
- Let the app trade for you with smart predictions.
- Watch your money and trades in a desktop window.
- Get live market updates.
- Set your own API keys for market data and exchanges.
- Train the app's smart brain to improve trading.

## How to Get Started
1. Download the latest ZIP from the GitHub 'Code' button and unzip it.
2. Follow the steps in `BUILD.md` to create the executable.
3. Use `TESTING.md` to test the app on your computer.
4. Share it with others using `DISTRIBUTION.md`.

## What You Need
- A computer with 8GB RAM and 20GB free space.
- Python 3.11 (to build the app).
- Internet for market data and API setup.

## Notes
- The app uses a single database file (`neuralnet.db`) and a central model (`models/central_model.pkl`) for all users.
- Keep your API keys secret and store them safely.
- This project no longer supports web or server setups (e.g., Docker, Nginx).

## More Help
- **Build Instructions**: See `BUILD.md`.
